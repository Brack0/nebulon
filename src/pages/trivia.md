_The code name Nebulon does not refer to the character from the Marvel universe. It comes from the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate in Star Wars. If the galactic empire is the IT world, then I'm part of the rebel alliance fighting [[x] Driven Development](https://devdriven.by/) and defending human values. As an example, you may have been triggered by the subtitle of this blog about microservices. Maybe that's what brought you here. Basically, I have nothing against it. However, the uses in industry are excessive and often praised, while many products sustain damage (Distributed big ball of mud, development costs, lower testability). One day I will make a post to explain what I blame microservices for. This article will be more a criticism of the gap between needs and the solution than a satire of deployment in microservices._
